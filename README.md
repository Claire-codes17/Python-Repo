# Python Projects 🐍

Welcome to my Python learning repo!  
Here, I’m sharing my Python scripts, mini-projects, and learning notes as I progress.

## What you’ll find here:
- Basic Python scripts (variables, loops, functions)
- Automation projects
- Practice exercises

I’m new to coding and will update this repo regularly with new code.
